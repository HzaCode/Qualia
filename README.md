In philosophy, **qualia** refers to the subjective, qualitative character of experience—the way things seem to us.

Raw research data is often messy, noisy, and riddled with errors that obscure the true story it contains. Straight-lining respondents, illogical survey answers, and unreliable scales are like "static" that hides the real qualia of the phenomena you are studying.

**Qualia cleans this static.** By systematically identifying and flagging these issues, it allows the genuine 'character' of your dataset—the underlying patterns and authentic stories—to emerge with clarity. It transforms data cleaning from a mechanical chore into an insightful process of discovery.
