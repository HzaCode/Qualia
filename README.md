Raw research data is a **phenomenon**. It is the data as it appears, clouded by the "filters" of collection errors, respondent biases, and logical inconsistencies. Straight-lining respondents, illogical survey answers, and unreliable scales are phenomenal distortions that obscure the objective truth you seek.

**Noumenon systematically strips away these phenomenal layers.** By identifying and flagging these distortions, it allows you to move beyond mere appearance and get closer to the underlying reality your data representsâ€”the **data-in-itself**.
